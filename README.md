# Smart bike light!

For this project, you'll need the following hardware:
 
 * A raspberry pi 
 * 2 arduino's with wireless capabilities. We've used 2 NodeMCU ESP8266's
 * The hardware as defined in the fritzing diagrams.
 
 
In order to run this project, be sure to start the MQTT broker first. 

> nodejs app.js

Then, upload the scrips to the arduinos. You'll have to set your MQTT broker's IP address and your wifi's SSID and WPA2 key in the sketch before you upload them.
